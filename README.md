## Description
An interactive online database which publicly displays expecting mother's wishlists.  Other users can then login and interact with the wishlist, signifying whether or not each gift has been purchased already.  Using the capabilities of react, when an item has been clicked as purchased, it instantly updates the database, displaying to other potential gifters that this item has already been purchased.

## Installation 
* Clone the [github repo](https://github.com/pardue95/group-5-project-3) to your machine.  
* From the command line install the necessary dependencies by entering `npm install --y`.  
* Optionally, proceed to seed the database with the command `npm run seed`. Finally type in the command `npm run develop` and the page will then display on the default web browser.
* Alternatively, one can simply go to the deployed [heroku site](https://warm-springs-81654.herokuapp.com/) and skip the tedious task of installing the program onto one's local machine.

## Usage
* When the user signs up for the service on the signup page, they are prompted to input whether or not they are an expecting mother or a potential gifter.  
* Once the user is signed in, an expecting mother can create a public wishlist using the provided items that we have supplied in the initial code.  
* Gifters can view the public wishlists and can proceed to click on the box to display publicly that this product has been purchased.

## Future 
* Plans to use outside APIs such as Amazon or Ebay to provide links and photographs of the products to be displayed on the expecting mother's wishlists.  
* Plans to create a prompt to allow the expecting mother to input the emails of her party guests so they can be invited to the website. 
* Plans to give the expecting mothers more privacy control with their wishlists i.e. public, private, friends etc.  
* Plans to integrate facebook friends and other social network connections, as well as emails and phone contacts, so the user can easily and rapidly send wishlist invites.  
* Plans to integrate push notifications based on the amount of gifts that have been purchased, e.g. "Your wishlist is 50% fulfilled, would you like to invite more people?" or "Congrats, your wishlist is completely fulfilled, would you like to add more gifts?"
